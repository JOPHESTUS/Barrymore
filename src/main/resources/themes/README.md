# Theme Creation Guide #

## I know what I'm doing ##

Great! Simply add a file in this directory called [theme name].theme.properties and PR it into the repo. That's all!

## I have no idea what I'm doing ##

Right, it's really simple. Start by clicking on the little [+] icon. You can see it next to '/themes/'.

Once you've clicked that GitHub will start forking the repo. It does this automatically so that you don't even have to know anything about git.

Next up, name your file. Call it [theme name].theme.properties (without the square brackets!). Bear in mind that underscores will be replaced with spaces when Barrymore loads the file.

Then start typing up your theme! Look at other themes to understand the format for the file. Once you are done, just hit the 'Commit New File' button and open a pull request from the main page!

Simples :) If you have any problems with this join #Kezz101 on irc.esper.net and ask for support.
